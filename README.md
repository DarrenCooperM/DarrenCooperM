Hey! My name is Darren 

I'm a software developer from Auckland, NZ.

I have been studying full stack development, AI & Cloud with Mission Ready HQ since July 2022. 

I am a big fan of working with AI & Cloud and learning all things to do with backend development! 

At the moment most of my time is spent making projects through Mission Ready, I've built projects using: </br>
HTML, CSS, Tailwind, Javascript, Node.JS, Express, MySQL, React.JS.

A bit about me: <br/>
<li> love the gym <br/>
<li> love off-roading in my 4wd <br/>
<li> love discovering new music across all genres <br/>
<li> love learning anything and everything <br/>
<li> Big LOTR fan <br/>
